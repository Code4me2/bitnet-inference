# Changelog

## [Optimized] - 2025-06-15

### Added
- **Automatic CPU optimization** - Auto-detects CPU cores, memory, and selects optimal kernel
- **Energy efficiency monitoring** - New scripts to analyze and monitor BitNet.cpp energy usage
  - `scripts/analyze_bitnet.sh` - Identifies BitNet features and estimates efficiency
  - `scripts/monitor_energy.py` - Advanced energy monitoring with real-time metrics
- **Dynamic kernel selection** - Automatically chooses between I2_S, TL1, and TL2 kernels
- **CPU affinity support** - Dedicates CPU cores for optimal performance
- **Performance benchmarking** - `scripts/benchmark.sh` for systematic testing

### Changed
- **Dockerfile** - Now builds BitNet.cpp from source for self-contained deployment
- **docker-compose.yml** - Enhanced with auto-configuration environment variables
- **README.md** - Updated with comprehensive optimization documentation
- **Startup process** - New `start.sh` script with intelligent auto-configuration

### Technical Details
- Implements recommendations from Microsoft's BitNet.cpp for 2-6x performance improvement
- Reduces energy consumption by 55-82% compared to traditional models
- Maintains 100% API compatibility with existing endpoints
- Preserves N8N integration capabilities

### Scripts Overview
1. **detect_cpu.sh** - Detects CPU architecture, cores, memory for optimization
2. **select_kernel.sh** - Chooses optimal BitNet kernel based on hardware
3. **setup_model.sh** - Downloads and prepares BitNet models
4. **benchmark.sh** - Runs performance benchmarks
5. **analyze_bitnet.sh** - Analyzes BitNet usage and efficiency
6. **monitor_energy.py** - Real-time energy monitoring with detailed metrics

### Migration Notes
- The project was already using BitNet.cpp (not plain llama.cpp as initially assumed)
- All optimizations focus on maximizing the existing BitNet.cpp performance
- Docker image now builds from source for better reproducibility
