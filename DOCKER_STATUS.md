# Docker Build Status

## 🔄 Current Situation

The BitNet.cpp build process is complex and requires:

1. **Python dependencies** - torch, numpy, transformers (~800MB+)
2. **Code generation** - `setup_env.py` generates kernel-specific files
3. **CMake build** - Requires generated files to compile

## ⚠️ Issues Encountered

1. **Direct CMake build fails**
   - Missing generated header files (`bitnet-lut-kernels.h`)
   - These are created by `setup_env.py` based on model architecture

2. **Model download during build**
   - `setup_env.py` downloads models during Docker build
   - Adds significant build time and complexity

3. **Build context challenges**
   - Pre-built binary COPY fails due to .dockerignore
   - BitNet submodule complicates Docker context

## 💡 Recommendations

### 🎟️ Short Term (Current)

```bash
# Use the local runner script
./run_local.sh
```

This uses the pre-built binary in `BitNet/build/bin/llama-server` and is the fastest way to get started.

### 🚀 Long Term (Future)

1. **Pre-built Docker Images**
   - Build BitNet.cpp for common architectures
   - Host images on Docker Hub
   - Users pull without building

2. **Multi-stage Build Optimization**
   - Separate build and runtime stages
   - Cache Python dependencies
   - Minimize final image size

### 🔧 Alternative Approaches

If Docker is required now:

1. **Local Build + Docker Runtime**
   ```bash
   # Build locally
   cd BitNet && python setup_env.py
   
   # Use minimal Dockerfile
   FROM ubuntu:22.04
   COPY BitNet/build/bin/llama-server /usr/local/bin/
   # ... minimal runtime deps
   ```

2. **Volume Mount Approach**
   ```bash
   # Mount pre-built binary
   docker run -v ./BitNet/build:/build ...
   ```

## 🎯 Why This Matters

BitNet.cpp achieves its performance through:

- **Architecture-specific kernels** - I2_S, TL1, TL2 optimized for different CPUs
- **Generated code** - Custom bit manipulation routines
- **CPU feature detection** - AVX2, AVX512, ARM NEON support

The build process generates CPU-specific code, making it challenging to create a universal Docker image that maintains the 2-6x performance benefits.

## 📋 Status Summary

| Approach | Status | Recommendation |
|----------|--------|----------------|
| Local Binary | ✅ Working | **Use this for now** |
| Docker Build | 🔶 Complex | Experimental only |
| Pre-built Images | 🔵 Future | Ideal solution |
